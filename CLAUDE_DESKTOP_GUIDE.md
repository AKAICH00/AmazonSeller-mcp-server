## üí° Pro Tips

### Natural Language Works Best
Instead of technical queries, just ask naturally:
- ‚úÖ "What products am I selling?"

- ‚úÖ "Check if I have any low stock items"

### Be Specific with Dates
- "Orders from last week"
- "Inventory as of today"
- "Financial events from January 2025"

### Use ASINs and SKUs
- "Get details for ASIN B09PGPFVBH"
- "Update SKU BT042-035-09-01-01-0050PK"

### Ask for Summaries
- "Summarize my top-selling products"
- "Give me an overview of my inventory levels"
- "What's my best marketplace?"
