# ü§ñ ChatGPT Custom GPT Setup Guide

## Complete Guide to Add Your Amazon SP-API MCP Server to ChatGPT

Your MCP server now supports **Streamable HTTP transport** (the latest MCP standard), making it compatible with ChatGPT Custom GPTs!

---

## üìã Prerequisites

‚úÖ **ChatGPT Plus subscription** (required for Custom GPTs)
‚úÖ **Railway deployment** (free tier works!)
‚úÖ **API Key** (already generated and in your .env file)

---

## üöÄ Step 1: Deploy to Railway

### Option A: Using the Deploy Script

```bash
cd /root/projects/AMAZON-MCP/AmazonSeller-mcp-server

# Set your Railway API key in environment
# Make sure CHATGPT_API_KEY is in your .env file
./deploy-railway.sh
```

### Option B: Manual Railway Deployment

1. **Login to Railway**:
   ```bash
   railway login
   ```

2. **Link to project** (or create new):
   ```bash
   railway link
   # OR
   railway init
   ```

3. **Set environment variables**:
   ```bash
   # Amazon SP-API credentials
   railway variables set SP_API_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
   railway variables set SP_API_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"
   railway variables set SP_API_REFRESH_TOKEN="your_refresh_token"
   railway variables set SP_API_MARKETPLACE_ID="ATVPDKIKX0DER"
   railway variables set SP_API_REGION="us-east-1"

   # ChatGPT API key (from your .env file)
   railway variables set CHATGPT_API_KEY="YOUR_GENERATED_API_KEY_HERE"
   ```

4. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

5. **Get your public URL**:
   ```bash
   railway domain
   ```

   Save this URL - you'll need it for ChatGPT setup!

---

## üîß Step 2: Test Your Deployment

Before adding to ChatGPT, verify everything works:

```bash
# Test health endpoint (public, no auth)
curl https://your-railway-url.railway.app/health

# Test OpenAPI spec (public, no auth)
curl https://your-railway-url.railway.app/openapi.json

# Test MCP endpoint (requires API key)
curl -X POST https://your-railway-url.railway.app/mcp/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_GENERATED_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -d '{"method":"tools/list"}'
```

Expected responses:
- `/health` ‚Üí `{"status":"ok",...}`
- `/openapi.json` ‚Üí Full OpenAPI specification
- `/mcp/messages` ‚Üí List of 31 available tools

---

## ü§ñ Step 3: Create Custom GPT

### 3.1 Go to ChatGPT Custom GPT Builder

1. Open ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com)
2. Click your profile ‚Üí **"My GPTs"**
3. Click **"Create a GPT"**

### 3.2 Configure Basic Info

In the **Configure** tab:

- **Name**: `Amazon Seller Assistant`
- **Description**: `Helps manage your Amazon seller account using the SP-API. Can check inventory, orders, catalog, reports, and more.`
- **Instructions**:
  ```
  You are an expert Amazon seller assistant with access to real-time Amazon SP-API data through MCP tools.

  You can help with:
  - Checking inventory levels (FBA and FBM)
  - Managing catalog and product listings
  - Viewing and analyzing orders
  - Generating and retrieving reports
  - Monitoring pricing and competition
  - Managing FBA shipments
  - Accessing financial data
  - And much more!

  Always use the MCP tools to fetch real data from Amazon SP-API. Never make up or estimate data.
  When users ask about their Amazon business, use the appropriate tools to get accurate information.
  ```

- **Conversation starters** (optional):
  ```
  - Show me my current inventory levels
  - What orders came in today?
  - Check my catalog for out-of-stock items
  - Generate my sales report for last month
  ```

### 3.3 Add Actions (MCP Connection)

1. Scroll down to **"Actions"** section
2. Click **"Create new action"**
3. **Import from URL**: `https://your-railway-url.railway.app/openapi.json`

   *(Replace `your-railway-url` with your actual Railway domain)*

4. The schema should auto-populate. Verify you see:
   - Endpoint: `/mcp/messages` (POST)
   - Endpoint: `/health` (GET)

5. **Authentication**:
   - Click **"Authentication"** dropdown
   - Select **"API Key"**
   - **API Key**: `YOUR_GENERATED_API_KEY_HERE`
   - **Auth Type**: `Custom`
   - **Custom Header Name**: `X-API-Key`

6. Click **"Save"**

### 3.4 Test the Connection

In the GPT preview (right side):

```
Ask: "List all available Amazon tools"
```

The GPT should use the `/mcp/messages` endpoint and return a list of 31 tools!

### 3.5 Publish Your GPT

- **Privacy**:
  - "Only me" - Keep it private
  - "Anyone with the link" - Share with team
  - "Public" - List in GPT store

- Click **"Publish"** or **"Update"**

---

## üß™ Step 4: Test Your Custom GPT

Try these queries in your new Custom GPT:

```
1. "What Amazon seller tools do you have access to?"
   ‚Üí Should list all 31 MCP tools

2. "Show me information about ASIN B08N5WRWNW"
   ‚Üí Should fetch catalog details

3. "What's my current FBA inventory?"
   ‚Üí Should list your inventory summaries

4. "Get my orders from the last 7 days"
   ‚Üí Should fetch recent orders
```

---

## üîê Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Keep your `CHATGPT_API_KEY` secret
- Use Railway's environment variables (never commit to git)
- Rotate API keys periodically
- Monitor Railway logs for suspicious activity
- Use HTTPS only (Railway provides this automatically)

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Share your API key publicly
- Commit `.env` file to git
- Use the same key across multiple services
- Make your GPT public with your personal Amazon data

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed" in Custom GPT

**Check**:
1. API key in GPT Actions matches your `.env` file
2. `CHATGPT_API_KEY` is set in Railway environment variables
3. Header name is exactly `X-API-Key` (case-sensitive)

**Fix**:
```bash
# Verify Railway environment variable
railway variables
```

### "Connection timeout" or "Cannot reach server"

**Check**:
1. Railway deployment is running:
   ```bash
   railway logs
   ```
2. Health endpoint responds:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-railway-url.railway.app/health
   ```

**Fix**:
```bash
# Redeploy if needed
railway up --detach
```

### "No tools available" in GPT

**Check**:
1. OpenAPI spec is accessible:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-railway-url.railway.app/openapi.json
   ```
2. GPT Actions schema imported correctly
3. Test MCP endpoint directly:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-railway-url.railway.app/mcp/messages \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_KEY" \
     -d '{"method":"tools/list"}'
   ```

### "Tool call failed" errors

**Check Railway logs**:
```bash
railway logs --tail 100
```

Common issues:
- Amazon API credentials invalid
- Rate limiting
- Marketplace ID mismatch

## üí° Usage Tips

### Optimize Your Prompts

**Instead of**: "What's my inventory?"
**Better**: "Show me my FBA inventory for all SKUs with quantity less than 10"

**Instead of**: "Get orders"
**Better**: "Get all orders from the last 7 days with status Pending"

### Batch Operations

The GPT can chain multiple tool calls:

```
"Give me a complete sales overview:
1. Today's orders
2. Current FBA inventory levels
3. Out of stock items
4. Pending shipments"
```

### Custom Reports

```
"Create an inventory report for the last 30 days, then tell me when it's ready and download it"
```
