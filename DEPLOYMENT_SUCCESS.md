# ✅ Railway Deployment SUCCESS!

## 🎉 Your Amazon SP-API MCP Server is Live!

**Deployment Status:** ✅ Live on Railway
**Health Check:** ✅ Passing
**Authentication:** ✅ Working
**Local Integration:** ✅ Configured

---

## 🔒 Security Status: SECURE ✅

### What's Protected:
- ✅ **All MCP tools** - Only accessible locally via stdio (not exposed on Railway)
- ✅ **Amazon credentials** - Stored securely in environment variables
- ✅ **Business data** - Never exposed via HTTP endpoints

### What's Public (Safe):
- `/health` - Basic health check (no sensitive data)
- `/auth-status` - Auth verification (only success/fail status)
- `/metrics` - Server metrics (uptime, memory usage)

**Your MCP server uses stdio transport** - it CANNOT be accessed over the network. Only local processes can connect to it.
